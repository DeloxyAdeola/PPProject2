# PPProject2
Overview.
This is an independent project done by me. The main goal of this project crowdfunding project for an independent funding is quite an interesting one. As requested by the organisation, working closely on this project to acheive the maximun and accurate analysis.

I extracted data from different database source, tranformed the data by checking for duplicates, droping null values, clean and worked on the data needed for our analysis. We created a relational diagram which incloudes 5 tables, the primary and foreign keys were assigned which helped out in relating our tables for a clearer analysis and also to get the information needed. we used Python, Pandas, Regex approches and jupyter notebook to achieve an accurate analysis. finally exported our data as a csv file.

The ETL process was time demanding but it was worth the outcome.
This project was done by me.
