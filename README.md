# PPProject2
Overview.
This is an independent project done by me. The main goal of this project id to analyse the financial performance of the company over a period of time and the effect on logistics based on the shipping period, working closely on this project to acheive the maximun and accurate analysis.

I used Python, Pandas, Regex approches and jupyter notebook to achieve an accurate analysis. finally exported our data as a csv file.
The CSV file was visiualised using Tableau.

I extracted this superstore data from kaggle.com. Tranformed the data by checking for duplicates, droping null values, clean and worked on the data needed for our analysis. 

The ETL process was time demanding but it was worth the outcome.
Findings:
1. Total sales during the expected period
2. Shipping duration based on shipping time .
3. 
This project was done by me.
